## About the Collection

Mason Abercrombie Shufeldt was a sailor from Zanesville, Ohio. In December of 1882 he boarded the U.S.S. Enterprise to sail to Madagascar, leaving behind his fiance Elise. Mason wrote to Elise nearly everyday, describing his life at sea and continuously expressing his love for her.
