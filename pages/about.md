## About the Collection

CONTENT WARNING: Please note that some of the letters in this collection contain harmful descriptions of people of color and discussions about slavery. 

Mason Abercrombie Shufeldt was a sailor who served on the Ticonderoga during its around-the-world voyage in the late 1870s. His father, Robert Wilson Shufeldt, was well known for playing a major part in opening trade with China and Korea in the 1880s. After his time aboard the Ticonderoga, Mason Abercrombie Shufeldt spent time in Zanesville, Ohio, where he met his fianc√©e, Elise Buckingham. In December 1882, he boarded the U.S.S. Enterprise to sail to Madagascar. Mason wrote to Elise nearly every day, describing his life at sea, drawing pictures of scenes from his travels, and expressing his deep love and longing to be reunited with her. On March 7th, 1883, Mason received a letter from Elise expressing her desire to break off their engagement. Mason continued his trip and went on to become the first known explorer to traverse the island of Madagascar.

Mason's letters are held at the Lilly Library in Bloomington, Indiana. You can find more information about his letters through the IUCAT listing for the materials [here](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/8376778).
